The organization is as follows.  Components directory contains reusable components that can be accessible within any view.  Your layouts are contained in the layouts directory.  Everything else are directories that contains views and their name matches that of a related controller except api-docs.  The api-docs directory does contain views but are automatically generated when the user performs the `php console make:api` command.  These docs are generated by a tool called doctum that creates Application Programming Interface (API) documentation based on phpdoc comments.
