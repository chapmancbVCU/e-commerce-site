# Chappy.php Starter Application

[Visit our Wiki](https://chapmancbvcu.github.io/chappy-php-starter/)

**Chappy.php** is a lightweight, extensible MVC PHP framework designed for developers who want clarity, power, and flexibility in their projects.

Originally a fork of the Ruah PHP MVC framework inspired by Freeskills’ YouTube series, we've expanded it with modern tools, cleaner structure, and new features.
